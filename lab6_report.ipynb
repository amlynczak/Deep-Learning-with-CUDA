For smaller examles we should use (3,3) and for bigger ones (5,5) - in those cases the model should work perfectly. We should also avoid the even numbers in kernel size - its linked with finding the middle of matrix that is written. We cannot also use (1,1), becouse there will be no neigbours to middle of the matrix and it is not doing any extraction. So to remember is this - use (3,3) or (5,5) kernel size (of course, choose those sizes wisely)."],"metadata":{"id":"bddVeBZTrojD"}}]}
